# Project Walkthrough

This file outlines the step-by-step process I followed to build and test the CloudTrail Log Analyzer using Python and AWS.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:

- Retrieve AWS CloudTrail logs from an S3 bucket
- Detect suspicious behavior (logins from unexpected locations, no MFA, root usage)
- Geolocate suspicious IPs
- Output results to a `.txt` file

---

## 1. Project Setup

### Tools & Services Used
- AWS CloudTrail
- AWS S3
- IAM for user access
- Python (Boto3, Requests, gzip, json, datetime)
- VS Code

### ðŸ”‘ IAM Configuration
Created a new IAM user with programmatic access and permissions:
- `s3:ListBucket`
- `s3:GetObject`
- `cloudtrail:DescribeTrails`
- `cloudtrail:GetTrailStatus`

---

## 2. Log Retrieval

The script uses `boto3` to:
- List CloudTrail logs from the S3 bucket
- Download the most recent `.gz` log file
- Extract and parse it as JSON

### ðŸ“¸ Screenshot: Log Retrieved
_Add screenshot here of a successfully downloaded and extracted log file in terminal._

```bash
Latest log file: AWSLogs/.../log.json.gz
Log extracted to: latest_log.json
