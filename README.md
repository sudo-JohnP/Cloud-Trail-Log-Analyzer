# AWS CloudTrail Log Analyzer

A Python tool that automatically downloads and analyzes AWS CloudTrail logs to flag suspicious behavior, including:
- Console logins without MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)
- AssumeRole events
- Access from unusual IP addresses

This project showcases my growing experience in cloud security, automation, and AWS services.

---

## What It Does

- **Fetches CloudTrail logs** from an S3 bucket (automatically created when CloudTrail is enabled)
- **Extracts** `.json.gz` log files and parses their content
- **Analyzes** each event for suspicious patterns
- **Generates a report** (`suspicious_report.txt`) with details on any risky activity found
- **Looks up IP geolocation** for login events to identify unusual access patterns

---

## What I Learned

- Using **AWS CLI** and configuring IAM access
- Automating S3 interactions with **Boto3**
- Parsing and filtering structured **CloudTrail logs**
- Writing meaningful detection logic
- Integrating **IP geolocation APIs** (ipinfo.io)
- Writing to local files for automated reporting

## üìÇ Project Steps

This project was designed to automate the detection of suspicious events in AWS CloudTrail logs using Python. Below are the key steps I took to build and test the tool.

---

### 1Ô∏è. Configure AWS CLI and Create CloudTrail

- Used `aws configure` to link the AWS CLI with my IAM user's credentials.
- Created a new CloudTrail trail to continuously log account activity.
- Verified that logs were being written to an S3 bucket.

---

### 2Ô∏è. Develop Python Script to Process Logs

- Used `boto3` to connect to the S3 bucket and download the latest `.gz` CloudTrail log file.
- Decompressed and parsed the JSON log for analysis.

---

### 3Ô∏è. Analyze for Suspicious Events

The script flags:
- Console logins with **no MFA**
- API calls to services like `lambda`, `iam`, etc. from **unfamiliar IPs**
- Root account usage
- Any activity from **non-US IPs** (using IP geolocation via `ipinfo.io`)
- <img width="1131" height="472" alt="SUS ACTIVITY EXAMPLE" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/696a02fc-6ce3-406d-ab77-d0562b5982e4" />

---

### 4Ô∏è. Write Results to Text File

- Analysis results are written to a `suspicious_events_report.txt` file for easy review or alerting.
- If no issues are found, the message `No suspicious events found.` is returned.
- <img width="1082" height="410" alt="BEST NO SUS FOUND" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b866d97-4edf-47f6-ba48-57cc4189ceae" />

---

### 5Ô∏è. Test with Custom Log

- Created a simulated CloudTrail log with known suspicious activity to verify the detection logic.
- Confirmed that the script correctly identified the anomalies.

This shows how Python can be used to monitor AWS environments for potential security risks. A key concept in cloud security automation.
